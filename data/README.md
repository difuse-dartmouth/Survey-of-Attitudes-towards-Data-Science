# Validation data
This folder contains the data we used in the construction and validation of the instrument.  
## Wave 1
We conducted a pilot survey to gather preliminary data afor scale development and revision. We collected data from 226 undergraduate students from several introductory STEM and Social Science courses.

The participant demographics exhibited diverse backgrounds, education levels, and nationalities. The sample included participants from several graduating classes: 26.7% from the class of 2023, 23.3% from 2020, 24.4% from 2021, and 25.6% from the class of 2022. Regarding first-generation status, 12.7% were first-generation college students, while a large majority of 87.3%were not. The citizenship status among participants was predominantly US citizens (84.8%), followed by non-citizens at 10.9%, with the remaining as Canadian citizens or permanent residents.

We used a second wave of data collection to validate the instrument and evaluate reliability, collecting data from 166 undergraduate students.

The sample included participants from several graduating classes: 3% from the class of 2021, 4% from the class of 2022, 15% from the class of 2023, 78% from 2024.
