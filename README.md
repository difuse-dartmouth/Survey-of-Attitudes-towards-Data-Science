The Survey of Attitudes toward Data Science (SADS) is an instrument designed to probe studetns' attitudes and beliefs within four constructs:  interest in data science, career aspirations in data science, perceived value of data science, and self-efficacy in data science. The survey was developed by Zhushan Li, Scott Pauls, and Olivia Szendey through the DIFUSE project at Dartmouth College and funded by the National Science Foundation award IUSE-1917002.

We have validated the survey and found it to have high reliability.  Data used to develop and validate the instrument are in the _data_ subdirectory.
